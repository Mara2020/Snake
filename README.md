Project Title: Snake

Team members: Randi Derbyshire, Bianca Angotti, Celeste Chiasson

Description:

Our group plans to recreate the classic Nokia game SNAKE using our Arduino board. The final product will be able to have the basic elements of the original Snake game, where there is a menu screen, difficulty options, a moving Snake, food circles, and a snake length display at the bottom.

Milestone due dates:

Nov 13
— Snake - dot that moves on its own with joystick (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

— Game start menu screen

— Fail game screen

— boundaries - goes to fail screen (return to menu screen) if hit

Nov 18
— food dots on the screen (1 at a time in predetermined spots)

— snake gets longer if it eats a food dot

— Fail game screen (return to menu screen, with total length of the snake included)

Nov 24
— random food dots (1 at a time in random spots)

— game over if you run into yourself

Nov 30
— difficulty levels (3 speed levels - easy (slow), medium (regular), hard (fast)) in screen
